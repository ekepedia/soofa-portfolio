<h1 class="entry-title">Why Top 20?</h1>

<div class="single-content"><h4>Did you know that the average Real Estate Agent only does 11 transaction a year according to the latest NAR statistics? That is a little less than one a month and is averaged over all of the agents in the country. In most areas the averages can be a lot lower. Do you want to trust the most important decision of your life to somebody who may not have made a sale in weeks or even months? Real estate markets are fast moving, complex and require deep local and personal knowledge. The best Agents, the Top 20 Agents are always the people who work harder, dig deeper and connect better with buyers and sellers. That is why they are the best and that is what we are here to help you find.</h4>
    <br/><h4>Did you also know that 90% of home buyers and sellers tend to work with the first agent they meet. This is often somebody working an open house for buyers. Very often these are newer and less qualified agents used by the more experienced agents to cover those events with the enticement of keeping buyer clients who come to that open house. Do you really want somebody new to the business to handle finding your dream home, investment or future?</h4>

    <h1>Why work through us?</h1>
    <h4>I think we can all admit that buying a home is exciting but really stressful. Even for those of us who work in the industry, the finding and choosing of a home is extremely painful and frightening. In this realm, what you don’t know can really hurt you. I know for me that when I go looking for property I first start by finding the best resource for information and trends that I can get my hands on. Sometimes this can be found on the internet but that information is widely available and not necessarily there to answer my specific questions. What is the real difference in the school districts, will I like this neighborhood or even what town is better?</h4>
    <br/><h4>So much of that is subjective and requires the knowledge and focus of a true professional Real Estate Agent. When I am looking for my home I want to work with the best. The best agents are the ones who have the real pulse of the market, know homes before they come on the market and are easily worth the money. Top 20 is here to highlight and help you find the best agents in any given town or market. Our metrics are based on sales volume which is not a complete measure of an agent but absolutely shows who is doing the most business and therefore has to be better, work harder and know more to be on top. By choosing to connect to an agent through us we will help you find the best fit and give you some money to offset the costs of purchasing a home. From inspections issues to financing charges we will give you a little extra cushion to this hard decision.
